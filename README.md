# UnityLearnRunner

Runner from Unity Learn Programmer Unit 3
A project for a term. Idea and materials taken from Unity Learn.
During development, I tried to concentrate on speed, without losing quality as much as possible. I did it in 2.5 hours. 
I think the experiment was successful. Dissatisfied with the class Player.cs
There is a lot of room for improvement. For example add PoolObjct in Spawner.

You can play on Unity
